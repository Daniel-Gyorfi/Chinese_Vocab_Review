The program will display chinese character definitions from a properly formatted file(see example.txt) and, 
pon user input, display the character itself. Note that in order for the program to properly read keypresses, 
it must be run from the command line. In order for chinese characters to display in the windows command 
line, it may be necessary to run "chcp 936" before running vocab.py. This will only change the codepage of 
the command prompt until it is closed.
